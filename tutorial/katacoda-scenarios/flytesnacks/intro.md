# About Flyte 

[Flyte](https://github.com/lyft/flyte) is a workflow automation platform for complex, mission-critical data and ML processes at scale.

This tutorial gives a hands-on demonstration of Flyte -- setting the environment up, registering a workflow, triggering it using Flytectl, monitoring it on Flyte console, and again, iterating on the example, registering it, and running it. You'll use an existing ML workflow available in the flytesnacks repo.
